# How to make link hover effect

- Create a main wrapper div 
- Create an anchor tag inside the wrapper div and for the text use span tag
- Create a cursor div inside the wrapper div
- Style it with CSS make the wrapper center and for each anchor tag make a transition effect
- For the text span also make a transition effect with pointer events none
- For the cursor make fixed position with the transform transition effect
- When hovering the anchor tag the cursor will transform and scale up
- Make it repsonesive for smaller screens
- In javascript select the cursoe and the anchor tags
- 

# Its logic

- When we hover the text the cursor will scale up and follow the mouse pointer
- When we remove the mouse pointer from the text the cursor will scale down to its original size
